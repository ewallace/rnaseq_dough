# rnaseq_dough
RNA-seq analysis of yeast during bread dough fermentation for teaching Autumn 2023

Edward Wallace, Edward.Wallace@ed.ac.uk

The goal of this repository is to do a basic analysis of RNA-seq data from the paper:

> Dynamics of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Transcriptome during Bread Dough Fermentation
> Aslankoohi et. al.
> Appl Environ Microbiol. 2013 Dec; 79(23): 7325â€“7333.
> doi: 10.1128/AEM.02649-13

The objective is to re-analyse the published data using the [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq) pipeline.

Analysing the data up to the point of counts per gene will provide a dataset to teach in the 2023 Data Exploration in Biology Courses at the school of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh.
